# Thunderchild

Thunderchild is a turn-key CMS solution built atop Django. It is inspired by ExpressionEngine by EllisLab.

## Requirements

[Django 1.4](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
[Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

## Features

* Create your own entry types with custom fields to fit your data. No being boxed into a fixed schema.
* Publish entires to templates using standard Django template tags. Create pretty URL's.
* Full cache support. Take advantage of Django's cache framework on a per-template basis.
* Built-in media manager for uploading files.
* Multiple user support (still work-in-progress).
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). Thunderchild uses this excellent front-end framework for rending it's own templates.
